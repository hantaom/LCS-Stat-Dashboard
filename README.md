### Git
The default branch will be set to 'dev', thus all work will be merged to here.
To start working on an issue,
1. Head over to `dev` branch

   `git checkout dev`  
2. Create a new branch

   `git checkout -b name`  
   For example: `git checkout -b hantao`  
3. After you did work, commit your changes. It's good practice to commit often and describe what you did in each commit

   `git commit -m 'added user model'`  
   
4. Commits only apply locally until you push it to your branch
   
   `git push` or  
   `git push origin hantao`  
5. Greetings friends, just testing commit.
